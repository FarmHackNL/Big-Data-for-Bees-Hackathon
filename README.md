On the 14th and 15th of December, at the Campus of the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science, we will be delving into Big Data and Bees with teams committed to building data driven solutions using big data technologies to help save the bees. The 30 hour hackathon is part of the [National Bee Strategy](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/natuur-en-biodiversiteit/bijenstrategie).

# Data

## Naturalis

### Modelled prediction of butterflies in The Netherlands

Maxent modelled binary (0 or 1/presen or absence) predictions for Dutch butterfly species at the scale of The Netherlands. 

Each column represents a butterfly species in the Netherlands and each row a 100 x 100 m grid cell in the Netherlands. A 1 indicates that a species is predicted by the model to occur in that grid cell and a 0 indicatesthat a species is not predicted by the model to occur in that grid cell. 

The x and y coordiantes correspond to the centroids of the polygons in grid_100m_NL_rd.shp file.

#### Purpose
To show the predicted distribtuion of butterfly species across the Netherlands in unsampled areas.

#### Modelling protocol

The modeling is conducted using a species distribution modeling approach. Species distribution models create a mathematical representation of a known species' distribution within the environmental space. We used the software,  MaxEnt (version 3.4.0). For each species we run five models with linear and quadratic terms allowed.

#### Metadata

*Coodinate system*: [Amersfoort / RD New](http://epsg.io/28992)

*Dimensions*: 91 Columns 3999220 Rows

*Butterfly Species*: 89

### Modelled prediction of wild bees in The Netherlands

Maxent modelled binary (0 or 1/presen or absence) predictions for Dutch wild bee species at the scale of The Netherlands. 

Each column represents a wild bee species in the Netherlands and each row a 100 x 100 m grid cell in the Netherlands. A 1 indicates that a species is predicted by the model to occur in that grid cell and a 0 indicatesthat a species is not predicted by the model to occur in that grid cell. 

The x and y coordiantes correspond to the centroids of the polygons in grid_100m_NL_rd.shp file.

### Modelled prediction of plants in The Netherlands

Maxent modelled binary (0 or 1/presen or absence) predictions for Dutch plant species at the scale of The Netherlands.
 
Each column represents a plant species in the Netherlands and each row a 100 x 100 m grid cell in the Netherlands. A 1 indicates that a species is predicted by the model to occur in that grid cell and a 0 indicatesthat a species is not predicted by the model to occur in that grid cell. 
 
 The x and y coordiantes correspond to the centroids of the polygons in grid_100m_NL_rd.shp file.


#### Purpose
To show the predicted distribtuion of plants across South Holland in unsampled areas. The selection of species was chosen to represent species important or unique to South Holland.

#### Modelling protocol
The modeling is conducted using a species distribution modeling approach. Species distribution models create a mathematical representation of a known species' distribution within the environmental space. We used the software,  MaxEnt (version 3.4.0). For each species we run five models with linear and quadratic terms allowed.
